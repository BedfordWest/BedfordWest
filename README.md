## Hi! 🙋 I’m Bedford (he/him/his). I'm a software engineering leader 💻 with a particular passion for advancing the developer experience through growth and psychological safety 🌱.

#### My philosophy toward engineering is driven whole-heartedly by one simple belief: On a software development team, we’re all learners and we’re all in this together :family:. For me, this means understanding more about what makes engineers engaged, psychologically safe, and fulfilled :green_heart:. As an engineering leader, this means I do my best to get to know each and every member of my department, understand their motivations, and work tirelessly toward earning their trust and advancing their careers.

#### In my down time, I enjoy building and expressing my creative side and keeping my tech skills relevant through game development 👾.
