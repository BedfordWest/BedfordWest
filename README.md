## Hi! 🙋 I’m Bedford (he/him/his). I'm a software engineering leader 💻 with a particular passion for advancing the developer experience through growth and psychological safety 🌱. Outside of this, I enjoy expressing my creative side and keeping my tech skills relevant through game development 👾.

#### In my day job, I lead Quality Assurance and testing teams toward innovative solutions for complex problems. In my spare time, I dabble in game development, experiment with one-off hobby development projects, and follow game jams. Diversity, equity, and inclusion :rainbow: are huge motivators for me, and I do my best to bring those into everything I do.

#### My philosophy toward quality is driven whole-heartedly by one simple belief: On a software development team, we’re all developers and we’re all in this together :family:. For me, this means driving folks in quality assurance disciplines toward more technical understanding while encouraging developers to take ownership toward more robust testing and quality.

#### Beyond this philosophy, I firmly believe in taking care of the people we work with :green_heart:. As a manager and department head, this means I do my best to get to know each and every member of my department, understand their motivations, and work tirelessly toward earning their trust and advancing their careers.

#### Most importantly, I am totally committed toward advancing 👌👌🏻👌🏼👌🏽👌🏾👌🏿 diversity, equity, and inclusion :heart: :orange_heart: :yellow_heart: :green_heart: :blue_heart: :purple_heart: in technology and beyond. I have been a member of the company DEI teams at my previous two positions, and I actively participate in and advocate for these issues whenever I am able. I believe we are at our best as technologists when we correct inequities in our workforce and push for safe, inclusive environments for everyone.
